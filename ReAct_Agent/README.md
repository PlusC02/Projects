This is a ReAct Agent implmented with:
- Message History Utility: It manages not only the message, but also the token tracking , and context management. Using a truncation methods. You may replace it with other techniques such as summarization etc.
- Tool Utility: It implement basic tools utility and would execute based on given parameters. No need to worry about local or MCP as all should be listed in System prompt

Hence, it could be counted as an Agent as it has 3 basic component of Agent: **LLM**, **Memory** and **Sensory**

Highly appreciate Anthropic, as the implementation is twisted from their implementation, and hence could be easily extend to applying MCP tools
